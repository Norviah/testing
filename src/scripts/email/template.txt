Dear [Name],

At Trio Development, we're actively searching for off-market opportunities for the upcoming year and beyond. Specifically, we're interested in acquiring knockdowns or vacant land in Newton, Brookline, Needham, Wellesley, and Weston. The ideal lots should be no smaller than 12,000 square feet and can be zoned for either single or multi-family use. The majority of our deals involve +$1m in acquisitions. With that said, we will of course consider all ventures on a deal by deal basis. We prioritize building long-lasting relationships: if we buy with you, we sell with you.

We look forward to collaborating with you and your team on any potential opportunities.

Please reach out to Ilya Fuchs at <a href="tel:6179051700">617.905.1700</a> or Allen Shlayen at <a href="tel:6178946234">617.894.6234</a> with any opportunities or questions you may have.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to work together.
