Dear [Name],

At Trio Development, we're actively searching for off-market opportunities for the upcoming year and beyond. We are raising a significant amount of capital that will need to be deployed in the next year. Specifically, we're interested in acquiring value-add multi family assets in [City]. We are open to more distressed assets as well for the right price. The ideal unit count will be 12-50 units. The majority of our deals involve + $1m in acquisitions. With that said, we will of course consider all ventures on a deal by deal basis. We prioritize building long-lasting relationships! 

We look forward to collaborating with you and your team on any potential opportunities. Please reach out to Adam Gluzman at <a href="mailto:adam@triobuilds.com">adam@triobuilds.com</a> or Allen Shlayen at <a href="mailto:allen@triobuilds.com">allen@triobuilds.com</a> with any opportunities or questions you may have.

Thank you for considering this opportunity.
